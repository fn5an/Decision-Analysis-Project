# Decision-Analysis-Project
In this project, I assumed that I am able to detect people’s implicit bias, and if they have an implicit bias, I am able to detect their Implicit bias type. In this case, my Decision Tool Project is, decide whether using strategy ai is the best way to mitigate that person’s implicit bias. In other words, decide which strategy works effectively for a specific type of bias.
