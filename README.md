# Decision-Analysis-Project-Fateme-Nikseresht
In my research experiment, I am going to collect some data from participants to understand how their bodies react to some different senses, including fear, stress, yelling, feeling down or sad, anger, surprise, excitement, and happiness. I will collect their data by a wrist band called Empatica E4 that has high accuracy. Then, I want to use the data set to elicit participants' emotions according to participants' body reactions. For the decision-making system project, I assumed that I recognized the user's emotional status, and I have the user's profile, including gender, personality, and preferences. In this case, my Decision Tool Project is, decide which strategy the best way to enhance the user's current emotional status? In other words, decide which approach works effectively for a specific type of emotion and a certain user.
